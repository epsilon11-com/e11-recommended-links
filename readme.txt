Show a admin-recommended links and descriptions on the page with a shortcode or
the sidebar with a widget.


== Description ==

e11 Recommended Links seeks to provide an easy way to share links to things
you feel might be of interest to your users.  It can be added with a shortcode
to be displayed within an index of posts, where it will show links that were
added around the same time as the posts, or as a sidebar widget, where it will
display links at random.  Both features may be enabled at the same time, and
links can be configured individually to show up in one or both of the areas.


== Installation ==

[TODO] Finish.

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Plugin Name screen to configure the plugin
4. (Make your instructions match the desired user flow for activating and installing your plugin. Include any steps that might be needed for explanatory purposes)


== Screenshots ==

[TODO] Finish.

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
2. This is the second screen shot
